    "\n",
    "- Token (word) counts that have been tagged with part-of-speech in order to disambiguate homophones and enable a greater variety of analyses\n",
    "- Various line-level information, such as the number of lines with text on each page, and a count of characters that start and end lines on each page\n",
    "- Header and footer identification for cleaner data. \n",

    "Within each Extracted Features file, features are provided per-page to make it possible to separate text from paratext. For instance, feature information could aid in identifying publishers' ads at the back of a book.\" \n",

    "HTRC also provides a Python library that allows for access to these features. Today, I will quickly share a method to use the Download Helper tool in Google's Colab environment, then show some features of the Python library. "
